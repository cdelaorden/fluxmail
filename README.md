# FluxMail

A Flux + React reference application, using `react-router`. For learning purposes.

I'm using it myself to play with the Flux SPA architecture.

This is loosely based on [BBCloneMail](https://github.com/Foxandxss/bbclonemailBBCloneMail), the Marionette.js reference application originally created by its author.
